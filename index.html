    <h2>Understanding Cloud Computing</h2>
    <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
    <p>
        Cloud computing allows users to store, manage, and process data on remote servers
        accessed through the internet instead of on local computers or physical hard drives.
        This enables scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloud Storage vs Traditional Storage</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional storage relies on local devices such as USB drives or internal hard disks.
        Cloud storage stores data on remote servers maintained by providers like AWS or Google Cloud,
        allowing access from anywhere with an internet connection.
    </p>

<!-- INTERNET TECHNOLOGY SECTION -->
<section id="internet">
    <h2>Internet Technology Demonstration</h2>

    <h3>DNS Server Functionality</h3>
    <p>
        A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
        For example, when a user enters <strong>www.example.com</strong>, the DNS server returns
        its corresponding IP address so the browser can locate the web server.
    </p>

    <h3>Broadband Connection Example</h3>
    <p>
        Fiber-optic broadband uses light signals transmitted through glass cables to provide
        extremely fast and reliable internet access. It supports high-speed data transmission
        for streaming, cloud applications, and online gaming.
    </p>

<!-- DATA TRANSMISSION SECTION -->
<section id="data">
    <h2>Data Transmission Example</h2>

    <h3>Full-Duplex Communication Diagram</h3>

(Send & Receive simultaneously)
    </pre>

    <h3>Error-Checking Method</h3>
    <p>
        One common error-checking method is a checksum. The sender calculates a value based
        on the data being sent. The receiver recalculates the checksum and compares it.
        If the values do not match, an error is detected.

<!-- INTEGRATION & SYNTHESIS SECTION -->
<section id="integration">
    <h2>Integration, Synthesis, and Cloud Hosting</h2>

    <h3>Journey of a Data Packet</h3>
    <p>
        When a user enters a website URL, the browser first contacts a DNS server to obtain
        the IP address. The data packet then travels through routers across the internet,
        reaching the destination server. The server processes the request and sends data
        back to the browser, where it is displayed as a web page.
    </p>

    <h3>Server-Side Cloud Hosting</h3>
    <p>
        Hosting this project on a cloud platform means the files reside on remote servers.
        The server handles HTTP requests, making this server-side hosting. Users access the
        application through their browsers without storing the files locally.
